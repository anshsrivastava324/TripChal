# States & Stones

**States & Stones** is a web project consisting of three main pages:  
- **Home Page**  
- **Stones Page** (showcasing famous Indian monuments)  
- **About Us Page**  

This project was created as part of an assignment where we were provided with 9 UI elements to implement, with the requirement to incorporate the mandatory loader page (element 1) and at least 3 elements overall.
